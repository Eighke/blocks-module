## Gateways

Gateways are extensions that provide configured APIs for the Payments module to utilize.

### Configuration

After installing your payment gateway extension you will need to configure it.

#### Settings Configuration

You can easily configure your extension by using the Settings module. Simply navigate to **Settings > Extensions**.

#### Config

If your website or application does not use the Settings module you can use regular config files / `.env` file to configure the addon.
 
Please see the config directory as each gateway extension is configured differently.

### Payment Processing

The payment processing supported by `payments` can be ran through gateways as well. Simply provide an instance of the `PaymentInterface`.

```php
$extension->purchase(new PaymentModel([
     'amount'           => 25.00,
     'currency'         => 'USD',
     'first_name'       => 'Ryan',
     'last_name'        => 'Thompson',
     'number'           => '4242424242424242',
     'type'             => 'visa',
     'security_code'    => '123',
     'expiration_month' => '12',
     'expiration_year'  => '2020',
     'gateway'          => 'stripe',
 ]));
```
